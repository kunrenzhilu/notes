how to synchronize between team works? If one havnt update but edit before hand?

Git repo corresponds to a specific directory. Per commit will sychronize the whole repo into the git cloud repo.

git "add" index/register the file to git commit

git commit claims that a bunch of update has been committed, is okey for upstream pushing to the remote repo. \br however, it's not yet update to the remote repo

git remote add create a remote git repo, e.g. the githup repo, and then register the name of that remote repo locally. 

git push [remote-aliasname] [branch] finish the sychonization between local and remote repo

Scene 1. I "mv snort-2-18 git_study_note". Then I "git add git_study_note", however, I didn't add the "snort-2-18". This lead to afterwards when I "git status", it shows 	
	
	deleted:    snort-2-18

And at this point, I "git push -u name git". Then I go and check from web, it showed both snort-2-18 and git_study_note exist. The reason is I didnt add the the change of snort-2-18 to commit.
