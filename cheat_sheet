## Use the following command line to read from file to tcpdump command
## sudo nohup tcpdump $(cat easyfilter)
## Note, the file path following the -w must be a full path, which means that neither $HOME nor ~ could be recognized by the tcpdump. Also, should not use tcpdump "$(cat easyfiler)", in which case tcpdump will recognize the every args following -i as the interface name, for unknown reason

## location of interface.d and interface
/etc/network/interface

## location of the system.d or .service file

#or the following
sudo hostapd -dd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

## dmesg is the tool to log boot information before the syslog daemon is setup in the kernal buffer ring, such that all information can be read.
## GRUB2 is a boot instruction program such that to control which os, and how that os be booted after reading MBR. I used the dmesg to track how the network interfaces being renamed and the use th GRUB to configure the network interface to be no-renamed. can be seen from /etc/default/grub. Following the link
